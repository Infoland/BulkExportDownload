This is a commandline tool written in C# that can be used to download one or more bulk exports from iProva using the API.
This tool will download a bulk export and extract it to a configured folder path. 

The tool comes with a configuration file App.config that can be used to set up the tool to your own needs. 
The settings in the configuration file are explained in the "Readme explaining App.Config settings.txt" file. 

Note: Currently iProva SaaS supports downloading Bulkexport zip files of max 4 GB size.

NB2: Even though the working of this tool is not guaranteed, Infoland does supply new build releases which are stored in [Releases](https://github.com/Infoland/BulkExportDownload/releases).
